# Russian Olympiad in Informatics 

The Russian Olympiad in Informatics is held every year. It consists of four stages - school, city, regional and final.

Schoolchildren from the >=5th (or >=7th) grade can enter the first two stages (in each region there are different rules). The last two stages can only be passed by pupils of the 9th, 10th or 11th grade. However, sometimes a schoolboy is smart enough to study at <9th grade, and then he can enter to the olympiad for 9th grade.

The regional stage is the de facto largest competition of olympiad programming in Russia among schoolchildren. It is held on the same days in February in several cities - regional centers of the country (there are 85 regions in Russia, and almost everywhere this olympiad is held). The best ~250 participants are invited to the final.

The tasks for all participants are the **same**. Based on the results of the region, three lists by classes are created. In each list the passing score is calculated, in such the way that, for example, ninth-graders had 25% of all participants in the finals, tenth-graders 31%, eleven-graders 42%. This is done so that younger students can gain experience for next years. Despite the small number of participants, passing scores in grade 11 are always much higher than passing scores in grade 9.

Nevertheless, the diplomas are issued in the final stage from the single scores list.

The final is held in one big city. Participants come for a week, live in institute hostels or hotels, go on excursions and lectures. It is all free and paid by the government.

Both stages consist of two IOI-like tours. Each tour lasts 5 hours and offers 4 tasks. The difference between the tours is 2 days.

Here are my sources for 3 years of participation in the olympiads and comments to them.
